"""Traffic workloads

Every traffic workload to be used with Icarus must be modelled as an iterable
class, i.e. a class with at least an `__init__` method (through which it is
initialized, with values taken from the configuration file) and an `__iter__`
method that is called to return a new event.

Each call to the `__iter__` method must return a 2-tuple in which the first
element is the timestamp at which the event occurs and the second is a
dictionary, describing the event, which must contain at least the three
following attributes:
 * receiver: The name of the node issuing the request 
 * content: The name of the content for which the request is issued
 * log: A boolean value indicating whether this request should be logged or not
   for measurement purposes.

Each workload must expose the `contents` attribute which is an iterable of
all content identifiers. This is needed for content placement.
